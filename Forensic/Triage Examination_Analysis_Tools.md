## $MFT
```
The term MAC(b) times denotes a series of timestamps linked to files or objects. 
These timestamps are pivotal as they shed light on the chronology of events or actions on a file system. 
The acronym MAC(b) is an abbreviation for Modified, Accessed, Changed, and (b) Birth times. 
The inclusion of b signifies the Birth timestamp, which isn't universally present across all file systems 
or easily accessible via standard Windows API functions.```
